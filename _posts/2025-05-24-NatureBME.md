Congratulations to Dr. Yihang Chen on his paper publication in Nature Biomedical Engineering! Paper title: "A biochemical sensor with continuous extended stabiity in vivo". Paper link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01389-6. 

The team demonstrates stable aptamer sensor operation for weeks with smart surface engineering! This is a very challenging reserach topic, congratulations, Yihang!

Our CMOS/microfluidics flow-cytometry-on-CMOS system has been highlighted in Medicine Innovates series (https://medicineinnovates.com)! Please see link below: https://medicineinnovates.com/ghz-frequency-microfluidics-integrated-cmos-platform-label-free-cellular-dielectric-spectroscopy/. We believe that by miniaturizng electronics using a millimeter-sized chip yet at high performance will ofer the pathway for the next-generation medical biosensing devices.

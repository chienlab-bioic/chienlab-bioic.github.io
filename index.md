# Chien Lab

Our group's research focuses on integrated circuits and their convergence with bio- and quantum technologies. We are dedicated to creating sensors and devices for point-of-care diagnostics and emphasizing continuous monitoring through wearables, implantable devices, injectables, and swallowables. Additionally, we explore millimeter-wave ICs for communication, sensing, and interfaces for qubits. Please come talk to us if youâ€™re interested in!
